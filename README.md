Package removal can be customized by modifying the following sections of the script:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Using Oscdimg
The script downloads "oscdimg.exe", used to generate the ISO, from Microsoft's website. If you have any doubts, you can download it using the following steps:

1. Download the "Windows ADK" Package from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install).
2. Run the setup. During installation, only check the "Deployment Tools" option and continue the installation.
3. After installing, navigate to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Deployment Tools\amd64\Oscdimg". The "oscdimg.exe" file will be located there.
4. Copy the file and paste it alongside the script."
